Physics-Animation
=================

Various simulations of physics concepts

*This project has been a team project and I DO NOT take any credit for any of the work beside the menu layouts, the simple harmonic motion
animation as well as the doppler effect animation.*

This project contains 6 simulations, 2 for each of these physics categories: Mechanics, Waves & Modern Physics, Electricity & Magnetism.
I have been in charge of the Waves & Modern Physics category, which includes a simple harmonic motion simulation as well as a doppler effect
simulation. The graph included in each simulation has been a last minute add-on and is not completely functional. However, for the sake of
integerity I have not removed it. 

This project has been an exploration of the Java FX 2.0 API.
